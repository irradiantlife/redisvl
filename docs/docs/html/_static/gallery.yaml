# Metadata to create our example gallery. This YAML file does two things:
#
# 1. Used by `generate_gallery_images.py` to take snapshots of each item and place an image in `gallery`.
# 2. Used by our Gallery Grid directive to create the grid on our `examples/gallery.md` page.
#
# This file should only be modified by maintainer, contributors should add their project
# to the list of `gallery.md`.
